I obtained my M.S. degree from the School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.  I was also the research assistant of the State Key Laboratory of Information Security. Before that, I finished my internship in Sangfor, advised by Principal Researcher Kai Li. Even before, I got my B.S. degree from LanZhou University of Technology, advised by Prof. Tao Feng at Institute of Network and Information Security.
