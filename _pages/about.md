I am a PhD student at State Key Laboratory of Complex and Critical Software Environment at the Beihang University (BUAA), advised by Prof. [Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). I also work closely with Prof. [Aishan Liu](https://liuaishan.github.io/).

Prior to BUAA, I obtained my M.Sc. from the School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I also served as a research assistant at the State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before that, I had internship experience at SIP Lab@Sangfor and 360 Security Research Labs@Qihoo. I serve as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, TIFS, TDSC, CVPR, ACL, AISTATS, COLING, ECCV, and EMNLP.
