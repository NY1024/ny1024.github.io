I am a first-year PhD student at State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment at the Beihang University, advised by Prof. [Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). I also work closely with Prof. [Aishan Liu](https://liuaishan.github.io/).

Prior to BUAA, I obtained my M.S. degree from the School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.  I was also the research assistant of the State Key Laboratory of Information Security. Before that, I finished my internship in Sangfor, advised by Principal Researcher Kai Li. Even before, I got my B.S. degree from LanZhou University of Technology, advised by Prof. [Tao Feng](https://jitong.lut.edu.cn/info/1308/10677.htm) at Institute of Network and Information Security.
